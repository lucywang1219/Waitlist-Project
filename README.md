## Project Overview 
The main idea of this waitlist project is to develop a restaurant waitlist system that automatically communicates across customers, the front desk, and waiters. The topic we are exploring is the lack of efficiency in restaurant operations, and this project will generate a solution to increase the table turnover rate, receiving more orders while increasing customer satisfaction. 

The minimum viable product we aim to acheive is a workable and accurate system for users to search a restaurant and sign up for waitlists that 1) receives inputs from customers and restaurant waiters, 2) generates outputs that inform customers the estimated waiting time.

Our stretch goal is to develop pre-ordering and takeout services using the online menu, and generate backend data that can be used for future forecasting. 

## Learning Goals 
We hope to apply our gained Python knowledge to solve a real-life problem. As for particular learning goals, we aim to achieve the following: 

1) Utilize SQL to record customer information into the database

2) Work with user input to realize interaction with the backend

3) Develop simple, clean code that utilizes suitable functions

4) Smooth integration of backend and frontend programs 

## Implementation Plan 
For the minimum viable product, we plan to store the user input (contact information, group size) into a database using SQL. For user interface, there will be cutsomer user end and restaurant user end. The database will be visually presented to the restaurant end. The input on the restaurant end would be the table size (corresponding to group size entered on the customer end), and it will push notification to the upcoming group of customer. 

For the stretch goal, we can present the menu and the restaurants using Documenu API,  which stores US restaurants data and menus. 

## Collaboration plan
We will split our work into two parts including front-end and back-end and each part is completed individually and then integrate. We will meet twice a week to discuss the details about tasks, solve current problems and set goals for the next week. We separate into front-end and back-end because the process of creating a front-end interface and back-end coding can happens at the same time without messing up with otherâ€™s code. Also, these two parts require relatively different skill sets. 

## Potential Risks 
One of the biggest risk can be online collaboration. Because we split the work due to back/front end, there may be a mismatch at the end due to potential miscommunication or differed understanding of the program.

In addition to collaboration risk, time appear to be a big challenge as well. As it is approaching to the end of the semester, there are a lot of final projects due around this time. Therefore, we may have little collaboration when we can work together. 

Another challenge would be learning how to use SQL. Because none of us had experience with SQL, we would need to self learn. Given the limited time we have, we are worried that we will not be able to smoothly integrate SQL to record the data. 

## Additional Course Content
Editing database using SQL and integrating through python programming and some implications with flask and html would be helpful. As we currently do not have any knowledge in SQL language, we would appreciate a bit of help on SQL programming.
